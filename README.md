## Deployment:
### Prerequisites:
- gcloud cli
- google cloud account

### Steps:
1. make a new project on google cloud
2. authenticate the cli by running `gcloud auth login`
    - it will tell you to set your project id, select from prompt
3. OR `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`
4. run `gcloud build submit` at the root of this project to build and push the containers the cloud registry
5. run the `gcloud run deploy` chunk from below to deploy the service.


### Details:
Since Cloud run does not support multiple containers in the same service as it's allowed in a pod with K8S, a container that runs multiple processes is used. 

[Tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini) is used as the entrypoint of the container to help avoid creating zombie processes.

The container is built using Cloud Build, by either running 
```
gcloud builds submit
```
or from the [trigger](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/create-manage-triggers) created using the console, which needs the Dockerfile and other assets to be ready at the source repository.

Then deploy the service either by running 
```
gcloud run deploy if-monet-loved-dogs-more \
--image=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/monet_tfserving_streamlit:latest \
--cpu=2 \
--memory=2G \
--timeout=300 \
--max-instances=1 \
--min-instances=1 \
--platform=managed \
--allow-unauthenticated
```
Note that the number of instances is limited to 1 here regardless of the traffic. This is to make sure Streamlit will show all the images properly without throwing a `MediaFileManager: Missing file` [warning](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/1294#issuecomment-755042396).
